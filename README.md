# NeuroDetect

## Overview

**NeuroDetect** is an open-source project that aims to utilize artificial intelligence to detect early signs of mental health issues like depression and anxiety. These conditions are often difficult to identify early due to subtle symptoms or stigma surrounding help-seeking behavior. NeuroDetect analyzes social media posts, written text, and voice recordings to identify early indicators of mental health concerns.

The project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **speech analysis**, and other machine learning techniques to understand emotional content, tone, and behavioral patterns. By analyzing user-generated content, such as:

- **Social media posts** to detect negative sentiment or changes in communication style.
- **Voice recordings** to identify vocal markers like pitch or tone that may indicate emotional distress.

NeuroDetect provides a platform where users can track mental health metrics over time through an in-app dashboard. The app offers personalized recommendations to promote well-being, such as mindfulness exercises or guidance to seek professional help.

## Key Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Utilize NLP and speech analysis to detect changes in emotional state through text and voice analysis.
- **Mental Health Tracking**: Users can track mental health over time via a personalized dashboard that visualizes changes in sentiment and mood.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on analysis, users receive tailored suggestions for improving mental health, such as mindfulness activities or resources for professional help.
- **Ethical Data Handling**: NeuroDetect emphasizes ethical considerations, focusing on user privacy and obtaining consent for data collection and analysis.

## Technology Stack

NeuroDetect is built using Python and the following key libraries and frameworks:

- **MongoDB** (via `pymongo`): For storing and retrieving user data.
- **FastAPI**: For building a fast and efficient backend API.
- **Django**: For managing user authentication, data processing, and overall project structure.

## Ethical Considerations

As mental health data is highly sensitive, NeuroDetect places great importance on **data privacy** and **user consent**. All data collected is anonymized, and users can opt in to provide their information for analysis. Our goal is to offer early detection of mental health issues without compromising trust, ensuring that the platform remains ethical and responsible in its use of AI.

## Open Source

NeuroDetect is **open-source** and we encourage contributions from developers, researchers, and mental health professionals. Whether youâ€™re interested in improving the platform, adding new features, or providing feedback, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
